## Particle Simulator (JavaScript OOP)

## Description :
A simple JavaScript OOP project that simulates moving particles to demonstrate classes, constructors, this, and object memory.

## Concepts used :

JavaScript Classes
Constructor functions
Instance properties
Prototype methods
`this` keyword
Object state and memory 

## Project Explanation :

This project creates particle objects that have a position and a speed.
Each particle can move forward, updating its own position while sharing the same movement logic with other particles.

=> The goal of this project is not visual animation, but understanding how JavaScript objects:

- Store their own data
- Share behavior through prototypes
- Change state over time
